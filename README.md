# My personal website

## Goals
1. Lightweight: The less dependencies, the better
2. Performant: Should run easily on minimal hardware and support plenty of connections
3. Minimal: Leverage existing solutions

## Post storage
Posts are stored as markdown files in this repository.

This allows me to leverage a plethora of existing text editors to write my posts, 
and also avoid setting up an admin panel and authentication system.

## Development
To start the development server run:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
